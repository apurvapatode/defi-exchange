## Overview

Our DeFi Exchange Project allows users to:

- Trade cryptocurrencies in a decentralized and secure manner
- Lend cryptocurrencies to other users and earn interest
- Borrow cryptocurrencies with flexible repayment terms

## Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org): A development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum contracts
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/): A library to interact with Ethereum blockchain and its smart contracts
- [React](https://reactjs.org): A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org): A high-level object-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum

## Installation

To get started with the DeFi Exchange Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/username/defi-exchange.git
cd defi-exchange
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory, and add your Ethereum private key and Alchemy API Key:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
```

4. Compile the smart contracts:

```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

5. Start the local development server:

```sh
npm run start
```

The application will now be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
